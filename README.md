# Construct-Web-Status

Simple construct status page, entirely client-side. Uses jquery, bootstrap, websockets, and a few other loose bits. Due to lack of mDNS, printers are currently polled frequently.

Features
========
* **Automatic Connection** - Will automatically reconnect when construct-daemon crashes.
* **Looks fancy** - Because I can
* **BUGS** - Bugs everywhere! Can you catch them all?

Try it out
==========
To test this code out, simply put it somewhere accessible by a modern web browser, and add your printers to printer_list.js. This code has been tested on Firefox and chromium.
